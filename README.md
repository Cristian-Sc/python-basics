# 🐍 Python Basics

This repository contains a collection of beginner-level Python scripts and small projects developed as part of my programming and data science learning journey.

## 📚 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to practice and reinforce core Python concepts, including:

- Variables and data types
- Control flow (conditionals and loops)
- Functions and modular code
- Input/output and user interaction
- Error handling
- Basic file operations

## 📁 Structure

Each script or mini project will be organized in its own folder. This approach helps track progress and encourages clean organization from the start.
